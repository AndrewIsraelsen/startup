(This is gonna be so super good)

[My Notes](notes.md)

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

Foundation Calendar is a consumer first calendar. Simplified, Streamlined, Painless.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Foundation Calendar is a consumer first calendar. Many calendars focus on business' as their primary clients and consumers get left by the wayside. Foundation Calendar aims to get rid of the corperate fluff that most consumers never use and to instead be a painless fluid experience for those trying to organize their life.
